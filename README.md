## üìë About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

We make a mobile application that can give plant sugestion based on your location na dyour enviroment situation, such as
Nitrogen, Fosfor, an Kalium. With that data we send it to out Machine Learning model and the model will give us the
suggestion plant as result. The model itself created by using dataset. Our mobile application do communication with the
Machine Learning Model via API which created by our personil too.

<summary>  How to run </summary> 

1. Clone [this](https://github.com/panduwjaya/CropOptima-Fullteam.git) repository and open the folder
2. Open directory `/CloudComputing`
3. If you want to connect your application to a database, please deploy `/database-api` to Google App Engine.
4. If you want to use a Machine Learning model as an API, please run `/model-api` locally or deploy it to a virtual machine. Don't forget include the Machine Learning Model if you using model-api
5. Open your terminal and install all dependencies with

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run API

```sh
python3 main.py
```

5. Access API at `http://localhost:5000`

Notes:
`/database-api` doesn't work on localhost and need to be deployed to app engine. also need an working MySQL databases to work.
