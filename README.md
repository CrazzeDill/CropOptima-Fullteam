## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

We make a mobile application that can give plant sugestion based on your location na dyour enviroment situation, such as
Nitrogen, Fosfor, an Kalium. With that data we send it to out Machine Learning model and the model will give us the
suggestion plant as result. The model itself created by using dataset. Our mobile application do communication with the
Machine Learning Model via API which created by our personil too.
